- Read 'The Mom Test' over the weekend. [Rob Fitzpatrick's](https://robfitz.com/) writing style is really entertaining! 
- Plus, his years of running multiple ventures over the last decade add real credibility to this book.
- The book's subtitle does a perfect job of describing what it's about - "How to talk to customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is _lying to you_.
- "It’s not anyone else’s responsibility to show us the truth. It’s our responsibility to find it. We do that by asking good questions. The Mom Test is a set of simple rules for crafting good questions that even your mom can't lie to you about" -->

    1. <b>The Mom Test:</b>
        - Talk about their life instead of your idea 
        - Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future 
        - Talk less and listen more 

    2. <b>Getting back on track (avoiding bad data):</b>
        - Deflect compliments 
        - Anchor fluff 
        - Dig beneath opinions, ideas, requests, and emotions
    3.  <b> Mistakes and Symptoms </b>
          - Fishing for compliments. “I’m thinking of starting a business... so, do you think it will work?” “I had an awesome idea for an app — do you like it?” 
          - Exposing your ego (aka The Pathos Problem). “So here’s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you think?” “I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!” 
          - Being pitchy. “No no, I don’t think you get it...” “Yes, but it also does this!” 
          - Being too formal. “So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few questions for you and then I’ll let you get back to your day…” “On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you…” “Let’s set up a meeting.”
          - Being a learning bottleneck. “You just worry about the product. I’ll handle the customers.” “Because the customers told me so!” “I don’t have time to talk to people — I need to get back to coding!” 
          - Collecting compliments instead of facts and commitments. “We’re getting a lot of positive feedback.” “Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea.”

    4. <b>Asking for and Framing the meeting</b>
        - Vision - half-sentence of how you’re making the world better 
        - Framing - where you’re at and what you’re looking for 
        - Weakness - where you’re stuck and how you can be helped 
        - Pedestal - show that they, in particular, can provide that help 
        - Ask - ask for help

    5. <b>Results of a good meeting</b>
        - Facts - concrete, specific facts about what they do and why they do it (as opposed to the bad data of compliments, fluff, and opinions)
        - Commitment - They are showing they’re serious by giving up something they value such as meaningful amounts of time, reputation risk, or money 
        - Advancement - They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale

    6. <b>Signs you're just going through the motions</b>
        - You’re talking more than they are 
        - They are complimenting you or your idea 
        - You told them about your idea and don’t have next steps 
        - You don’t have notes 
        - You got an unexpected answer and it didn’t change your idea 
        - You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked 
        - You aren’t sure which big question you’re trying to answer
        - You aren't sure why you're having the meeting  
<br/>

- A _must-read_ for folks who are looking to build businesses of their own. Don't fall into the trap of seeking validation in compliments.
- Some noteworthy (and some chuckle worthy) rules of thumb :)
    - "Rule of thumb: People stop lying when you ask them for money."
    - "Rule of thumb: People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear."
    - "Rule of thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them."
    - "Rule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction."
    - "Rule of thumb: Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff."
    - "Rule of thumb: Go build your dang company already."
    - "Rule of thumb: It’s going to be okay."
